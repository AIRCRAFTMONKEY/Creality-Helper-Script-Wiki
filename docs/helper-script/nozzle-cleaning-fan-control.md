- You can change the fan speed, open `nozzle-cleaning-fan-control.cfg` file located in `Helper-Script` folder:

    - On original Fluidd Web Interface go to `Configuration` icon on the left side.
    - On original Mainsail Web Interface go to `Machine` tab on the left side.

- And change the `max_speed` value knowing that the max value is 1.0 (which corresponds to a speed of 100%).

    ```
    [prtouch_v2_fan]
    max_speed: 0.5
    ```

- Then, click on `SAVE & RESTART` button in the top right corner.

- During the nozzle cleaning process, the fans will now operate at the defined value.
