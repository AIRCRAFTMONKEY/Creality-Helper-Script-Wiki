This allows to control camera settings with macros.

!!! Warning
    **This feature is not compatible with the new hardware version of the camera.<br/>You can control settings if you use a USB Cam by installing <a href="https://github.com/trevos3d/K1-USB-Cam">USB camera from USB port</a>.**

!!! Note
    **This procedure must be repeated after restoring the printer to factory settings.**

- When restarting the printer your camera settings will not be preserved, to correct this open `camera-settings.cfg` located in `Helper-Script` folder and edit this lines with the desired values:

    ```
    [delayed_gcode LOAD_CAM_SETTINGS]
    initial_duration: 2
    gcode:
      CAM_BRIGHTNESS BRIGHTNESS=0
      CAM_CONTRAST CONTRAST=32
      CAM_SATURATION SATURATION=56
      CAM_HUE HUE=0
      CAM_WHITE_BALANCE_TEMPERATURE_AUTO WHITE_BALANCE_TEMPERATURE_AUTO=1
      CAM_GAMMA GAMMA=80
      CAM_GAIN GAIN=0
      CAM_POWER_LINE_FREQUENCY POWER_LINE_FREQUENCY=1
      CAM_SHARPNESS SHARPNESS=3
      CAM_BACKLIGHT_COMPENSATION BACKLIGHT_COMPENSATION=1
      CAM_EXPOSURE_AUTO EXPOSURE_AUTO=3
      CAM_EXPOSURE_AUTO_PRIORITY EXPOSURE_AUTO_PRIORITY=0
    ```

    !!! Note
        Here all macros are configured with their default value, you can remove unmodified ones if they don't need to be loaded when Klipper starts.
