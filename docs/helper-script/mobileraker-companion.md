  - On original Mainsail Web Interface go to `Machine` tab on the left side.

- And add this macro:

    ```
    [gcode_macro MR_NOTIFY]
    description: Allows to send custom notifications via Mobileraker without using the M117 command
    gcode:
      {% set msg = "MR_NOTIFY:" ~ (params.TITLE ~ "|" if 'TITLE' in params|upper else "") ~ params.MESSAGE %}
      {% if 'MESSAGE' in params|upper %}
        { action_respond_info(msg) }
      {% else %}
        { action_raise_error('Must provide MESSAGE parameter') }
      {% endif %}
    ```

- Then, click on `SAVE & RESTART` button in the top right corner.

- You can now use command in this format where you want in your macros to send push notifications:

    ```
    MR_NOTIFY TITLE="your_title" MESSAGE="your_message"
    ```

- When crafting your custom notification's title or message, you have the flexibility to incorporate placeholders that will be dynamically replaced by the Mobileraker Companion. These placeholders allow you to convey specific information relevant to the notification.

    !!! Example
        **Usage**: `MR_NOTIFY TITLE="I am $printer_name" MESSAGE="$file is currently printing!"`

- Below is a list of available placeholders and their corresponding replacements:
